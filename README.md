You must possess influencer talent Energy consultants keep an eye on a company's energy usage. Based on your findings and research, Energy Audit will be required to advise managers on ways to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability, lower utility costs, and comply with environmental requirements. Who'll also need you to design plans to implement your ideas? 2. You can work for a company or work for yourself. As an energy consultant, you can advance your career in three ways. One is to work directly as an energy manager for a sizable organization in the public or private sector. You'll be responsible for creating a long-term energy strategy that reduces expenses while increasing efficiency. 3. Cost-cutting and "going green" is essential. You might believe that many organizations' priorities will always be to cut costs, even at the expense of environmental considerations, whether you work for them or they are clients. 4.
